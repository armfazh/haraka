# Haraka v2

Haraka v2 is a secure and efficient hash function, designed specifically
to process short inputs and be very fast on modern platforms which
support AES-NI. One of the main applications for such a design is the 
use in hash-based signature schemes like XMSS and SPHINCS.

## Features
- Supports AES-NI
- Low latency
- High performance (below 1 cycle/byte on Skylake)

This repository provides a reference implementation and parts of the
software used for the security analysis. For more information see
our paper.
